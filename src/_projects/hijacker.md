# Hijacker

<!-- summary -->
Hijacker is a development tool I created to help mock API responses. It can be set up as a passthrough to a normal API endpoint, as well as mock new endpoints. Hijacker also has the ability to set up API "breakpoints" that allow you to edit requests from the client before they hit the API server and/or the responses from the API server before they are returned to the client. For latest development, check out the [beta](https://github.com/travis-w/hijacker/tree/beta) branch.
