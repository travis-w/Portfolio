# Blok Party

<!-- summary -->
Blok Party was built in 48 hours by Josh Taylor, Coy Kwan, Dylan Stanfield, and myself for Node Knockout 2019. In Blok Party, users can log in with their GitHub and claim a square in the tower to customize, the way they see fit. We won the innovation category in the hackathon.
